# Redesigned Portfolio (React + Vite + Tailwind + Framer Motion)

- Dynamic background that changes per section (edit `bgMap` in `src/App.jsx`).
- Smooth scroll animations and hover effects.
- Fully responsive, accessible, and semantic sections.
- Put your background images into `public/` as `bg-about.jpg`, `bg-education.jpg`, etc. A fallback `bg-default.jpg` is included.

## Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
```
